# TEST

<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "man/figures/README-",
  out.width = "100%"
)
```


## Purpose

This package calculates the area and volume of simple, and somewhat complex shapes. 

## Target Audience

There are two target audiences of our package. One is the user who wants R to run just like a calculator, so these functions are used to calculate these shapes. The other target audience is a young child first getting familiar with R, and writing code in R. They can use these functions to understand R and writing R code from the perspective of calculations they already understand!

## Installation

You can install the development version of Shapez like so:

```{r}
remotes::install_github("nliftman/shapez")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(Shapez)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
