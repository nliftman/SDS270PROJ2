This vignette summarizes the various information scattered throughout the R documentation and brings it together in one place. It goes through all of the functions in the package, their specifications, and examples.

### Loading the Package 

```{r setup}
library(shapez)
```

## Area Functions
### Area of a Rectangle

This function `area_square(width, height, graph)` calculates the area of a rectangle, along with, when requested a graph of the rectangle in question. 

The function requires `width`, `height`, and `graph` inputs, where `width` is the width of the rectangle, and `height` is the height. The final input `graph`, asks the user whether they would like the rectangle to be graphed. If the user inputs a 0, the function will simply compute the area and not graph the shape, but inputting a 1 will graph the shape.

Any negative or string inputs will throw an error for the `width` and `height` inputs, and anything other than a 0 or 1 will throw an error for the graph. 

The main purpose of the graph is to help people visualize what area is being measuring. This function calls another function `graph_square(x,y)`, to do the graphing for it. All of the graphing function can be called on their own, but are less user friendly.
```{r}
graph_square(3,5)
```


This calculates the area of a rectangle with no graph.
```{r}
area_rectangle(3, 5, 0)
```

This calculates the area of a rectangle and includes a graph.
```{r}
area_rectangle(3, 5, 1)
```

### Area of a Circle

This function `area_circle(radius, graph)` calculates area of a circle, along with, when requested a graph of the circle in question. 
The function requires `radius`, and `graph` inputs, where `radius` is the radius of the circle. The other input `graph`, asks the user whether they would like the shape to be graphed. Imputing a 0 will simply compute the area and not graph the shape, but inputting a 1 will graph the shape. 

Any negative or string inputs will throw an error for the `radius` input, and anything other than a 0 or 1 will throw an error for the graph. 

The main purpose of the graph is to help people visualize what area is being measuring. This function calls another function `graph_circle(x)`, to do the graphing for it.

### Area of a Triangle

This function `area_triangle(base, height, graph)` calculates the area of a triangle, along with, when requested a graph of the triangle in question. 

The function requires `base`, `height`, and `graph` inputs, where `base` is the base of the triangle, and `height` is the height. The final input `graph`, asks the user whether they would like the triangle to be graphed. Imputing a 0 will simply compute the area and not graph the shape; however, the user must know whether the triangle is a right or isosceles triangle to graph it. Inputting a 1 indicates that the triangle is an isosceles and inputting a 2 indicates it is a right triangle, and they will be graphed as such. 

Any negative or string inputs will throw an error for the `base` and `height` inputs, and anything other than a 0 or 1 will throw an error for the graph. 

The main purpose of the graph is to help people visualize what area is being measuring. This function calls another function `graph_triangle(x,y,type)`, to do the graphing for it.

This calculates the area of a triangle with no graph.
```{r}
area_triangle(3, 5, 0)

This function `area_trapezoid(base_1, base_2, height, graph)` calculates the area of a $regular$ trapezoid along with, when requested, a graph of the trapezoid in question. 

The function requires `base_1`, `base_2`, `height`, and `graph` inputs, where `base_1` is the length of the bottom base, `base_2` is the length of the top base, and `height` being the height of the trapezoid. The final input `graph`, asks the user whether they would like the trapezoid to be graphed. If the user inputs a 0, the function will simply compute the area and not graph the shape, but inputting a 1 will graph the shape. 

Any negative or string inputs will throw an error for the `base_1`, `base_2`, and `height` inputs, and anything other than a 0 or 1 will throw an error for the graph. This function calls another function `graph_trapezoid(x,y,z)`, to do the graphing for it.
